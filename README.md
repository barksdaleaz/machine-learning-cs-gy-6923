# machine-learning-cs-gy-6923

This repository holds PDF reports and R code for a 3-part project that was done over the course of the Spring 2022 semester at NYU Tandon. 
The course name was Machine Learning (class code: CS-GY 6923) and the professor was Raman Kannan.

# PART 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In Part 1, we were instructed to find a dataset and perform EDA on it to see whether it would be appropriate to use for the second part, running models.
I chose the Dry Bean Dataset from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dry+Bean+Dataset),
which is taken from the original paper titled [Multiclass classification of dry beans using computer vision and machine learning techniques](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168169919311573?via=ihub)
by Murat Koklu and Ilker Aliozkan in 2020.

# PART 2: Individual Classifiers

In the second part, we were instructed to build these models: 
1. Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes or LDA/QDA
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Decision Tree
4. K-Nearest Neighbor

and then determine the performance(s) using these metrics:

1. Roc Plot
2. AUC
3. Confusion Matrix
4. Accuracy
5. Specificity
6. Precision
7. Recall ( Sensitivity )

# PART 3: Ensemble Techniques

Pick any 3 of the following Ensemble Techniques below and compare the results with Part 2 (Individual Classifiers):

1. CrossValidation
2. Leave One Out Cross Validation
3. Bagging
4. Random Forest
5. Boosting
6. Stacking

Determine Variance and bias and compare. Include: what does cross-validation do to bias and variance?
